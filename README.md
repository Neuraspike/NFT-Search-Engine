# NFT-Search-Engine
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build your own NFT Search Engine using Python and OpenCV. We’ll first walk you through the concept behind image search engines: how they work, and finally, a guild on how to build your algorithm using any dataset.


## Dataset

For this tutorial, we will be utilizing a dataset that I manually scraped from the OpenSeas website (a market place where you could purchase NFTs) by downloading a bunch of NFTs profile picture projects.

The downloaded ones are:

    1) Bored Apes
    2) Cryptopunk, and
    3) Alien Frens


## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.8

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  scipy~=1.7.1
> *  numpy==1.17.4
> *  opencv-contrib-python

Otherwise, use the following command to install the packages according to the configuration file requirements.txt.

> *  pip install -r requirements.txt
